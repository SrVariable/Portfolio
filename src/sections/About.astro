        My name is Rojohn, but I'm usually known as <strong class="text-theme-yellow">SrVariable</strong>, or just Variable.
        I've been using a computer since I was 5. However, my programming journey started when I was 16, in highschool.
        I was introduced to algorithms, creating simple games in <strong class="text-theme-yellow">Scratch</strong>.
        The next year, I used <strong class="text-theme-yellow">PSeInt</strong> to dive more into programming and then switched to
        <strong class="text-theme-yellow">Java</strong>. I also learnt about <strong class="text-theme-yellow">HTML</strong>,
        <strong class="text-theme-yellow">CSS</strong> and <strong class="text-theme-yellow">WordPress</strong> and develop web pages.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Nowadays I'm studying in <em class="text-theme-yellow">42 MÃ¡laga</em>, a place where I enhance
        and learn the fundamentals of programming using <strong class="text-theme-yellow">C</strong> and
        <strong class="text-theme-yellow">C++</strong>. Alongside 42, I'm studying a
        <strong class="text-theme-yellow">Higher Technician in Web Application Development</strong> in
        <em class="text-theme-yellow">IES Salduba</em>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        I'm <strong>very curious</strong>, that's the main reason I'm always learning new things. It allows me to gain
        <strong>valuable knowledge</strong> I can share afterwards. Actually, one of my goals is to
        <strong class="text-theme-yellow">learn enough to understand that there is a lot to learn</strong>.
